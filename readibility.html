  <h2>Publishing a website and GitHub pages</h2>
  <p>There are several different platforms for publishing a static website. A common way is to buy or rent a server, and use it to serve documents to the world. On this course, we’ll actually use GitHub to publish a static website.</p>
  <p>GitHub pages is a free service by GitHub, which allows publishing static websites directly using a GitHub repository.</p>
  <p>We’ll start by creating a new repository, with an <span class="code">index.html</span> file and <span class="code">styles.css</span> file in a <span class="code">css</span> folder. Then we’ll add the following snippet of code into <span class="code">index.html</span></p>
